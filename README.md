# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

To run the website, the user needs to use the "Live Preview" feature in Visual Studio Code. The website consists of basic information about me and a clickable button. The button is binded to the sayHello() function which displays an alert box returning the string "hello". To run the tests provided, the user needs to give the path to the test in the URL. For example:

    http://127.0.0.1:3000/test/test.html
